Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area. The following sections outline the steps that you need to take to accomplish this task.

For this challenge, I used Xpert Learning Assistant, ChaptGPT, and got some help from a project that was similar (https://github.com/DataTell/sqlalchemy-challenge.git). I used these resources to help get started on some of the coding parts.
